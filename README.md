The application should contain one window in which a user will be able to set:
- time, day or weekdays, when alarm should ring,
- whether the alarm should repreat every week or not,
- the alarm volume,
- the alarm name.

The window should also contain two buttons: "save" and "Cancel".
On pressing "cancel" button the window should close.
On pressing "save" button the window should close, but whem exiting in a standard output (console) the earlier set information should be displayed (the hour, days in which to ring; should it be repeated or not, volume and name). The application is not to work as a real alarm clock, meaning it should not ring. It should only display the window and enable the user to choose settings or close it with an option of chosen settings display.
